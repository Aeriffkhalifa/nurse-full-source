'Don't worry, I'll find out for you, just wait a second.'

You've encountered so many people in this situation before.

You know how frightened and anxious they must feel - you must help. 

You run back to the reception and speak to the receptionist, quickly getting the right information, and run back to tell the waiting woman.

She still looks worried but she calms down a bit after hearing your reassuring words and sets off immediately to find her husband. 

You're glad that you were able to help, but you're  aware that time is slipping through your fingers.

It's time to continue your search for the medicines before it's too late.

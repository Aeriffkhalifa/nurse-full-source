You arrive at your patient's room and see that a medical team is there. They are busy at work trying to revive your patient. You have arrived too late. You did not deliver his medicines on time. 

You realise that you spent too much time along the way. You should probably have focused more on finding the medicines, instead of helping others who approached you. 

You feel fear growing inside of you. Your manager will not be happy about this. You were in charge here - you should have delivered the medicines on time. The family of your patient will be very upset - there will be lots of explaining to do. You fear - no, you know for certain - that you will be blamed for this. Your colleague made a similar mistake a few months ago and she was fired. You do not want to face the same end - but it was so difficult to say no to all those other people in need. The stress has taken its toll on you. You feel both physically and emotionally exhausted.

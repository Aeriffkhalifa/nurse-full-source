Suddenly you hear a man yelling from a nearby room. 

'Nurse!'

'Nurse! Help!'

You see that that the yelling is coming from a male patient who has recently had an operation. 

He has begun to bleed again - he needs someone to help him with his wounds. 

The man looks at you. It is clear that he is in pain.

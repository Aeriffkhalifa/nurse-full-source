You continue walking down the corridors. 

Suddenly you hear a man yelling from a nearby room. 

'Nurse!'

'Nurse! Help!'

You see that that the yelling is coming from a male patient who has recently had an operation. He has begun to bleed again - he needs someone to help him with his wounds. 

The man looks at you entreatingly. It is clear that he is in pain. 

Will you help the man or leave him to continue searching for the last medicine?

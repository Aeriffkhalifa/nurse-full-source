'I'm so sorry, but I can't help you, I'm in a rush to find some medicines.'

The elderly lady looks up at you, confusion clear on her face.

 'But... What am I to do...'

'Don't worry, another nurse will be here to help you soon' you say, feebly.

You realise that it may be minutes before another nurse will come this way.

The old lady will have no choice but to continue wandering about, lost and soiled. 

You feel so guilty.

It is difficult to turn away from her and as you walk away, you continue to hear her feeble calls:

'Nurse! Please, nurse!'

Every step you take feels heavier.

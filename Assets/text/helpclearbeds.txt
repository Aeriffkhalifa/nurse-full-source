More patients? There always seems to be more patients than the hospital can hold...

You have no choice, this bed needs to be cleared to give room to others in need. This is a matter that you cannot dispute. 

You nod and get to work immediately. 

When you finish, you rush off - there's not much time left. You need to find those medicines! Your patient is in grave danger.

You rush along the corridor. You're close to the last medicine cabinet now.

Suddenly a sharp beeping sound catches your attention from a room ahead. 

You quickly realise the source of the sound: a patient in critical condition has just flatlined and needs immediate help. 

You are also keenly aware that you are running out of time for finding the last medicine. 

Will you stay to help the patient or continue looking for the last medicine?

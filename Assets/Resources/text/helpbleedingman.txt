'Please, calm down, I am here to help you.'

How can you say no to a bleeding man, clearly in need of you? It's your duty as a nurse to stay and help! 

He gives you a grateful look and lies back down on the bed, letting you take a look at his wounds and stitches. You redo his bandages.

It only takes a short while before he stops bleeding, and he sighs in relief, thanking you with a tired look on his face. 

You are happy to have relieved his pain and anxiety, but you are starting to get more anxious about your own patient now. You need to hurry up.

You continue walking down the hospital's corridors and spot the second medicine cabinet.

You quickly retrieve the right medicine. Now you only need to find one more medication. 

Suddenly you see the bed manager walking in your direction.

She steps into one of the patient rooms close to you, scowls and then turns to you. 

'Nurse! I need the bed in this room cleared immediately.'

You peek inside the room, and see that an elderly woman lies, dead, on the bed.

The bed manager continues to speak to you:

'I really need this bed, we've had several new patients come in, you'll have to clear it for me.'

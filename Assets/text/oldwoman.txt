You keep walking down the corridors. 

'Nurse!'

A distressed woman approaches you. 

'Please, nurse, my mother, she's very old - and she's only just recovered from a hip operation. We've been waiting for the hospital to arrange for our transport home for over 2 hours now - please, can you speak to the staff to make sure that someone will pick us up soon? My mother is getting so tired - she needs to get home, she needs to get some rest!'

Will you help arrange transport for the old lady or continue to find the medicines for your patient?

Luckily, you make it back on time. The medicines work their magic. Your patient is once again in a stable condition. You managed to save him - but at what cost? 

You remember all the people who approached you on the way - you remember their stressed, anxious, pained expressions.

In order to find and deliver the medicines to your patient on time, you turned down so many others in need - patients, family members and fellow staff-members.

This was both physically and emotionally taxing. You disappointed so many people. 

Some of them desperately needed your help.

Did they get get help from someone else in the end?

You want to run back and help them all, each in turn, but you have other pressing duties to attend to.

 There are too many people to take care of, but too little time to do it all.

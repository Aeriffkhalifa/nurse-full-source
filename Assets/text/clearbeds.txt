You continue walking down the hospital's corridors and spot the medicine cabinet for the second medication that you need. You quickly retrieve the right medicine. Now you only need to find one more medication. 

Suddenly you see the bed manager walking in your direction. She steps into one of the patient rooms close to you, scowls and then turns to you. 

'Nurse! I need the bed in this room cleared immediately.'

You peek inside the room, and see that an elderly woman lies, passed away, on the bed.

The bed manager continues to speak to you: 'I really need this bed, we've had several new patients come in, you'll have to clear it for me.'

Will you stay to clear the bed or continue in search of the medicines?

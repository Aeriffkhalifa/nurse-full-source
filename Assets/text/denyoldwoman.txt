'I'm very sorry, but I can't help.' 

The woman looks as if she is about to cry.

You feel a pang of guilt.

'I need to find medicines for my patient - he's in a bad condition and I'm running out of time.' You know that you're refusing this woman for a valid reason, but it doesn't make you feel any better. 

Reluctantly, you leave the woman, and continue on your way.

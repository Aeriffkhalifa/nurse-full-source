You continue walking down the corridor and quickly spot the medicine cabinet for the first medication that you need. Finally! Now you only need another 2 medicines.

As you continue to walk down the corridor, a woman in tears runs toward you. 

'Nurse!'

'Please, nurse, I just found out that my husband has had a heart attack, I don't know where he is, please, help me find out where he is, I just need to see him, I'm so worried, I need to see him, I need to know that he is OK!'

Will you help the woman find her husband or continue in search of the medicines
